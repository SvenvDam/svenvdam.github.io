My name is Sven van Dam. 
I'm a data/software engineer living in Amsterdam with interests in software development, data science, cooking and wine.
I do most of my development in Scala and find myself being interested in functional programming.

I studied Econometrics at the University of Amsterdam.

Outside of work I spend a lot of time on food and wine. 
I like too cook and discover new recipes, learn about wine and pair the two together.
